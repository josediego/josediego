### Hi there 👋

I'm Jose Diaz, and I'm on a mission to build amazing things with code! 🚀 I thrive on the thrill of creative problem-solving and find my greatest joy in collaborating with exceptional teams.

💡 **Current Role:** As we speak, I'm the one working on a project that empowers white-label site creation with lightning speed. I've tackled the challenges of legacy code maintenance, migrating stacks, optimizing performance, and helped build the bootstrap for our automation stack.

🛠️ **Tech nerd:** In the realm of CI/CD workflows, I've orchestrated major transformations by using GitHub Actions as pipelines. My toolkit also includes Terraform for infrastructure management (efficiency FTW).

🎩 **From Engineer to Squad Lead:** I wore multiple hats - from Scala Engineer to QA Squad Lead. I've helped develop modules, integrated third-party services, and even tracked server issues. On the QA side, I've set up visual regression tests and E2E tests like a champ.

These experiences have shaped me into a versatile and dynamic professional who's ready to tackle any challenge in the world of technology.

#### 🎯 Areas of Expertise

- **Tech Stack:** I'm fluent in languages like Ruby, Scala, and NodeJS. I've got experience with multiple stacks.
- **Cloud Magic:** I tinker with AWS services to supercharge systems and have a knack for Terraforming infrastructure.
- **Startup Hustle:** I'm no stranger to fast-paced startups and have led teams to success.

#### 🛠️ Tech Toolbox

I work with a variety of tools and technologies including 

Ruby, NodeJS, Scala, Bash, RSpec, Mocha, K6, Selenium, Github Actions, Jenkins, Terraform, Pingdom, Splunk, Grafana, AWS, Heroku, Docker, Kubernetes, Postgresql, MongoDB, and Redis.

#### 💬 Languages

I'm fluent in English and Spanish.

Feel free to reach out if you want to chat about tech, startups, or anything cool! 😄
